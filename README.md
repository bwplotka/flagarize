# flagarize

Flagarize your Go struct to initialize your even complex struct from flags!

## Goals

* Allow flag parsing for any struct field using Go struct tags.
* Minimal dependencies: Only `"gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2"`.
* Allows custom flagarizing. (:

## Production Examples

To see production example see:

 * [Thanos](todo).
 * [Prometheus]()

## Example

```
TBD
```

## But Bartek, such Go projects already exists!

Yes, but not as simple, not focused on kingpin, and they does not allow custom flagarazing!  ðŸ¤—

## But Bartek, normal flag registration is enough, don't overengineer!

Well, depends. It might get quite weird. Here is how it could look with and without flagarize:
